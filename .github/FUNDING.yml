Welcome to AI-powered pair programming with GitHub Copilot! This guide will help you quickly onboard and configure Copilot for use with Python, Java, and C++ projects in this repository.

---

## 1. Enable Copilot for Your GitHub Account

1. Ensure you have a [GitHub Copilot license](https://github.com/features/copilot).
2. Go to **Settings > Copilot** in your GitHub account and enable Copilot for your user or organization.

---

## 2. Install the Copilot Extension

Copilot is available for popular editors:

- **Visual Studio Code**: [Copilot for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)
- **JetBrains IDEs** (IntelliJ, PyCharm, CLion, etc.): [Copilot for JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17718-github-copilot)
- **Neovim**: [Copilot for Neovim](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim)

Install the extension and sign in with your GitHub account.

---

## 3. Project-Specific Setup

### Python

- Use a virtual environment (`python -m venv venv`).
- Ensure `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` is present for dependency management.
- Copilot works best with clear docstrings and type hints.

### Java

- Ensure your project has a proper `pom.xml` (Maven) or `build.gradle` (Gradle) configuration.
- Use standard directory layouts (`src/main/java`, `src/test/java`).
- Document classes and methods for better Copilot context.

### C++

- Use a `CMakeLists.txt` or relevant build configuration file.
- Organize code in `include/` and `src/` directories.
- Comment header files and provide signature documentation.

---

## 4. Best Practices for Copilot

- Write descriptive comments and docstrings—Copilot uses them for smarter suggestions.
- Break up large files and functions for better context.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Regularly review and refactor Copilot's code for security and correctness.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

- If Copilot suggestions are not relevant, add more context or comments.
- For editor-specific troubleshooting, refer to the [Copilot Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot).
